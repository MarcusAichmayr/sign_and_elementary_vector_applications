# Applications of sign and elementary vectors

We demonstrate here applications and examples of the SageMath packages:

* [elementary_vectors](https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/elementary_vectors)
* [sign_vectors](https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/sign_vectors)
* [sign_crn](https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/sign_crn)
